            <h2>About Subhas Chandra Bose</h2>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, he was a brilliant student who excelled academically. Bose's strong nationalist views and commitment to India's freedom led him to join the Indian National Congress, where he became a key figure advocating for complete independence.</p>
            <p>Bose is celebrated for his charismatic leadership and strategic vision. He believed in the need for direct action against British rule and famously declared, "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!" His relentless pursuit of independence saw him forming the Indian National Army (INA) to fight against the British with the support of Axis powers during World War II.</p>
